	abstract = {Temperature is known to be an important mechanism affecting the growth and distribution of stream insects. However, little information exists that describes how variable temperatures are among streams of similar size, especially in physically heterogeneous landscapes. We measured summer daytime temperature and the structure of riffle benthic insect assemblages from 45 montane streams in California. Summer stream temperature was nearly randomly distributed across large-scale geographic gradients of latitude (6°) and elevation (2000 m). The lack of geographic trends in summertime stream temperature appeared to be caused by the strong relationship between local channel morphology and summer water temperature. Mean daytime water temperature was most strongly related to the \% of the channel present as pools, which did not vary systematically with either latitude or elevation. We used multiple multivariate regression analysis, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), and graphical techniques to both quantify differences in insect assemblage structure among streams and to determine the degree to which assemblage structure was related to temperature. NMDS analyses were conducted on 3 similarity matrices based on: 1) presence and absence of all aquatic insect taxa encountered during the study, 2) densities of the 16 most numerically abundant taxa, and 3) population biomasses of the 16 most common taxa. All 3 analyses showed that variation in assemblage structure among streams was significantly related to temperature, although assemblage structure was most strongly related to sampling date--a consequence of sampling over a 98-d period. Temperature probably influenced assemblage structure in 2 ways: 1) by influencing developmental rates of individual taxa and overall assemblage phenology, thus affecting the relative abundances of taxa found on a specific sampling date, and 2) by excluding taxa unable to tolerate certain temperature ranges. Because of the strong dependency of assemblage structure on temperature and the lack of strong geographic trends in temperature among these streams, much of the measured variation in assemblage structure appeared to be unrelated to latitude or elevation. These results have important implications for both our understanding of natural biogeographic patterns of lotic organisms and our ability to detect and model the effects of climate change and other thermal alterations on stream ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Water temperature is one of the main abiotic factors affecting the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems and its alteration can have important effects on biological communities. Macroinvertebrates are excellent bio-indicators and have been used for decades to assess the status of aquatic ecosystems as a result of environmental stresses; however, their responses to temperature are poorly documented and have not been systematically evaluated. The aims of this review are: (i) to collate and summarize responses of freshwater macroinvertebrates to different temperature conditions, comparing the results of experimental and theoretical studies; (ii) to understand how the focus of research on the effects of temperature on macroinvertebrates has changed during the last 51 years; and (iii) to identify research gaps regarding temperature responses, ecosystem types, organism groups, spatiotemporal scales, and geographical regions to suggest possible research directions. We performed a comparative assessment of 223 publications that specifically consider freshwater macroinvertebrates and address the effects of temperature. Short-term studies performed in the laboratory and focusing on insects exposed to a range of temperatures dominated. Field studies were carried out mainly in Europe, at catchment scale and almost exclusively in rivers; they mainly investigated responses to water thermal regime at the community scale. The most frequent biological responses tested were growth rate, fecundity and the time and length of emergence, whereas ecological responses mainly involved composition, richness, and distribution. Thermal research on freshwater macroinvertebrates has undergone a shift since the 2000s when studies involving extended spatiotemporal scales and investigating the effects of global warming first appeared. In addition, recent studies have considered the effects of temperature at genetic and evolutionary scales. Our review revealed that the effects of temperature on macroinvertebrates are manifold with implications at different levels, from genes to communities. However, community-level physiological, phenological and fitness responses tested on individuals or populations should be studied in more detail given their macroecological effects are likely to be enhanced by climate warming. In addition, most field studies at regional scales have used air temperature as a proxy for water temperature; obtaining accurate water temperature data in future studies will be important to allow proper consideration of the spatial thermal heterogeneity of water bodies and any effects on macroinvertebrate distribution patterns. Finally, we found an uneven number of studies across different ecosystems and geographic areas, with lentic bodies and regions outside the West underrepresented. It will also be crucial to include macroinvertebrates of high-altitude and tropical areas in future work because these groups are most vulnerable to climate warming for multiple reasons. Further studies on temperature–macroinvertebrate relationships are needed to fill the current gaps and facilitate appropriate conservation strategies for freshwater ecosystems in an anthropogenic-driven era.},

	abstract = {Wetlands of a large fluvial lake in the St. Lawrence River (Québec, Canada) were visited during 3 years (2004–2006) to collect macroinvertebrates across the belt of emergent vegetation. We tested the hypothesis that hydrology, river landscape, and local environment would explain variations in macroinvertebrates. The 66 taxa collected lake-wide comprised a few abundant but widespread groups (Malacostraca, Oligochaeta, Chironomidae, and Mollusca). Between 2004 and 2006, total abundance at 5 sites monitored annually fell by one order of magnitude, and taxa richness decreased from 19 to 12 taxa. Proportion of amphipods (Gammaridae) dropped sixfold whereas proportion of annelids (Oligochaetes) rose ninefold. The impoverishment of macroinvertebrates coincided with low summer water levels in 2005 and 2006, resulting in the periodic emersion of up-slope sites. Spatial differences in macroinvertebrate communities were less important than inter-annual differences, owing to large variability among sites. Patterns in macroinvertebrate communities were related to water depth, vegetation, and local changes in sediments (31\% of variance explained). Gammaridae (Malacostraca) were strongly associated with down-slope sites, whereas Oligochaeta (Annelida) dominated in up-slope sites. Inter-annual changes in water level had major effects on macroinvertebrate communities in Lake Saint-Pierre, above and beyond other environmental variables.},

	abstract = {Most publications on the influence of environmental factors on macroinvertebrate communities focus on large rivers, whereas relatively few examine small watercourses in agricultural areas, which, due to their size and pressure from intensive agricultural production, are much more susceptible to the effects of unfavourable environmental conditions or anthropopressure. The aim of our study was to compare the biodiversity of macrozoobenthos assemblages and to determine the effects of physicochemical and hydrological conditions on their abundance and density in 10 small rivers in agricultural areas located in northwest (53°23′ N 15°14′ E) and central (52°11′ N 20°48′ E) Poland. In total, 105 taxa were recorded, with the majority being euryoecious. Among the assessed physicochemical parameters, oxygenation was found to affect the density and number of taxa; another important factor was the content of nitrate nitrogen. Sensitivity to changes in water temperature was observed in some macrozoobenthos taxa (especially Decapoda). Of the examined hydrological parameters, the greatest effects were exerted by speed, flow, and depth.},

	abstract = {Patches of large and small pebbles were created in three riffles (fast current velocities) and three pools (slow velocities). It was expected that patches with different sizes of pebbles in the two velocity regimes would vary in the entrapment of fine sediments and organic matter, which in turn would result in differences in benthic community structure. This was not the case, for although deposition of fine material was greater in pools, there were appreciable location-specific differences in the fauna unrelated to the variables monitored in the experiment. Functional feeding groups did not respond predictably to the distribution of detritus. Generally, the community was least influenced by substratum size, with any differences being inconsistent across locations. Most other substratum effects were attributable to the presence of epilithon on undisturbed control patches. Velocity was the most influential factor, with riffles having higher total abundances and higher species richness. Some taxa showed strong location- specific differences. At the level of a small patch of pebbles, the colonization dynamics of the fauna are probably a mixture of species- and location-specific dispersal and selection mechanisms. At larger spatial scales, however, community structure is more predictable, with pools differing substantially from riffles.},
